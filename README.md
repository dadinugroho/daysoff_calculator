App to to calculate working days and days off


There are two ideas behind this application,

1. My first experience to create a full simple app using ReactNative. I think this can be toy project to learn ReactNative.
2. Help me to calculate the accumulated days off allowance during my contract works. The scenario is that I am working everyday for 15-20 days including weekend. Then, I can have some days off as the replacement of the weekend days and holidays that I am working on.

## Features of v0.1
- Calculate numbers of accumulated days off as the replacement of weekend days only.
- Calculate the next period start date

### Scenario 1 input
- Start Date of the period
- End Date of the period


## Features of v0.2
- Separate Setting screen to set working days and days off. For example, while most of workers will have days off on Saturday and Sunday, some of them will only have holidays on Sunday or Friday.
- Calculate days off by given next period start date

### Scenario 1 input
- Start Date of the period
- End Date of the period

### Scenario 2 input
- Start Date of the period
- Start Date of the next period
